1. better/real help file
2. Rename joevolt seems a bit protenches. Nameing is hard.
3. the code works but is slopy so clean it up. (install quarks dependencies kdtree ect)
4. Would like to for pitch detection  to use the Fluid Decomposition Lib Ugens or Tartini. Will probibly wait till the Fluid Decomposition Lib is release it as a Quark. I have used Tartini in the past but wanted everyting to work out of the box on a clean install of SC with out installing oter plugins.
